I bought a new PC a few weeks ago and I then decided to renew a bit my **Desktop**, my **Mutt** and my **Irssi** setup. I&#8217;ve been spending several hours cleaning up old scripts, logs and configuration files but the result definitely seems to reward me the right way. But here they come a few **screenshots**:

**Desktop**

**Irssi**

**Mutt**

If you liked all the above and would like to reproduce everything yourself, you should consider having a look at my GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/averi/config-files" target="_blank">repository</a>. See you on the next blog post!
