It&#8217;s been two years since my <a href="http://www.dragonsreach.it/2011/09/04/new-desktop-mutt-and-irssi-setup/" target="_blank">latest blog post</a> about my Linux desktop and many things have changed since then. I completely moved all my machines to **GNOME 3**, switched my main editor from **nano** to **vim** and myÂ terminal multiplexer from **screen** to **tmux**. What didn&#8217;t change at all except for a tweaks on the theme is my **Irssi** setup.

Switching from nano to vim has been a pain at first, nano is really a straightforward editor, it does what you actually need from a CLI editor but while it works just fine when modifying configuration or text files, it&#8217;s a bit limiting when it comes to programming. Vim on the other hand is highly customizable in every single part also thanks to its huge amount of plugins. Honestly I admit I spent several hours watching videos, reading documentation, trying out key bindings and I&#8217;m not completely used to vim to be as much productive I would like to be with it.

What I found to be the common error of vim&#8217;s newcomers is their willingness to look around the web for a complete vimrc configuration file, full of key bindings, custom settings and personalizations. That&#8217;s definitely something you should avoid when learning to use vim, the perfect **vimrc** doesn&#8217;t objectively exist, each of us should spend some time investigating what is the best configuration for your needs and build a vimrc accordingly time by time.

It will probably take months to have a complex vimrc file matching your needs completely, until then you won&#8217;t be able to define your vimrc to be &#8220;ultimate&#8221;. And that&#8217;s actually why wgetting someone else&#8217;s vimrc and copying it to your home folder won&#8217;t make you an expert of vim, it&#8217;ll probably make your life harder when trying a specific action with the stock settings will result in something you wouldn&#8217;t have expected thanks to a particular key binding on the vimrc you downloaded.

The other tool that definitely improved my productivity is **Tmux** given the huge amount of open terminals I had every day during my sysadmin&#8217;s duties at GNOME. Each day usually started with one or two open terminals mainly meant for random maintenance issues, after a few hours the amount of open terminals jumped to around 30.
