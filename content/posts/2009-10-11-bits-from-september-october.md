**Debian maintainer:**

Some days ago I had the great announcement that my [Debian Maintainer][1]&#8216;s application was accepted and thanks to Jonathan McDowell my key is finally into the debian-maintainers keyring. (which is now part of the debian-keyring itself thanks to the ftp-masters / keyring maintainer [work][2] that made the changes on both DAK and keyring)

I [applied][3] on the 22th of August, and thanks to Reinhard&#8217;s [advocation][4], everything went on the right side. Many thanks to all the people who made this possible.

**Pkg-mozext:**

Around 3 weeks ago I started being involved with the pkg-mozext team working on the new policy and to [mozilla-devscripts][5] transition for all iceweasel / icedove extensions. The work is going great so far and we managed to update several extensions that are now part of the team itself. For a fast look at our package list, feel free to browse pkg-mozext&#8217;s [QA page][6]. A lot of work needs to be done, so if anyone wanna jump in, I would suggest to read our guidelines / policy into the team&#8217;s [Wiki Page][7].

**Pkg-gnome:**

GNOME 2.28 is now released, and the pkg-gnome team is now working hard to provide all the needed updates into unstable and experimental. Everything is going great and we are cleaning up everything listed on [our schedule][8].

Ephipany is under transition (gecko &#8211;> webkit) so there are still some open issues / bugs, but now it looks fine so far and it can be used without any particular problem.
