I live in a little village close to the city and one of the houses close to my property is for rent since more than ten years. A lot of families and people succeeded in that house and every time someone new joined my **Linux** evangelist hat jumped in my head.

I&#8217;ve always presented myself as a **Linux** geek to my neighbours and it has been nice seeing how the Linux word evolved (with funny and surprising quotes) during the past ten years in their minds. A friend of mine ([Aretha Battistutta][1]) made a little comic strip out of the topic and the result is simply amazing.

Enjoy!
